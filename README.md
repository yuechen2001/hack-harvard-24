## 📖 Overview

**TradeREC** is a blockchain-powered platform built at **HackHarvard 2024** to facilitate secure, transparent trading of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) between businesses and households. The system promotes environmental accountability by enabling:

- Businesses to list and price RECs
- Households to buy RECs transparently
- Immutable logging of transactions using **Hedera Hashgraph**
- Simulated zero-knowledge encryption via **Midnight**

Our goal is to eventually evolve TradeREC into a fully private, decentralized, and scalable marketplace for green energy credits.
