## ðŸ”§ Setup

This app demonstrates how to use the OpenAI API with Python and Flask.

To run it, you'll need an OpenAI API key. The key is referenced in the `compose.yaml` file as `OPENAI_KEY`.

Use the Defang CLI to set it up:

```bash
defang config set --name OPENAI_KEY
```

You'll be prompted to enter your API key.
